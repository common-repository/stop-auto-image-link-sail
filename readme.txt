This plugin will simply stop WordPress automatically linking to image files / attachment pages when you insert an image into a post/page etc.

== Description ==

You know when you're adding an image to your latest post and you always have to change the 'Link To' option so that your image doesn't link anywhere? It's super annoying.

Just install this plugin and it will automatically select the 'No Link' option. Magic!
